# Prodigy Comics Website

A modern, responsive website for the Prodigy comic series - an action-adventure superhero series set in a world where humans are evolving into something more.

## About Prodigy

The world is changing rapidly with the discovery of T.B.E.'s (Terrestrial Biological Entities). The GODSTRAND, a mythic piece of the human DNA puzzle, was discovered by GOLDSTONE LABORATORIES during analysis of The Tunguska blast of 1908 in Siberian Russia.

When governments became aware that humans were mutating, a coalition was formed to deal with these extraordinary beings. The United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Israel head the World Council on dealing with these "humans" who have demonstrated tremendous abilities and strength beyond normal human capabilities.
