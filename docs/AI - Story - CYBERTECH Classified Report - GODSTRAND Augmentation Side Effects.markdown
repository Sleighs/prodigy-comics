### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
The GODSTRAND, a genetic sequence containing approximately 2 million chromosome pairs, has been partially mapped and utilized for human augmentation under Project WOLFPAK and related initiatives. While the augmentations grant extraordinary abilities, the side effects are profound, debilitating, and often fatal. This report compiles observed and projected side effects based on clinical trials, field data, and post-augmentation autopsies. The severity of these effects underscores the ethical and operational challenges of deploying augmented operatives.

### BACKGROUND  
The GODSTRAND, discovered by GOLDSTONE Laboratories, represents an unprecedented leap in genetic complexity compared to the human baseline of 23 chromosome pairs. Partial integration into human subjects has yielded Terrestrial Biological Entities (T.B.E.s) and augmented operatives (e.g., WOLFPAK, D.O.A.). However, the human body is ill-equipped to handle the genetic load, leading to systemic instability. The following sections detail the side effects observed in 87% of augmented subjects.

### DETAILED SIDE EFFECTS  

1. **Neurological Degradation**  
   - **Symptoms**: Subjects experience synaptic overload, manifesting as seizures, hallucinations, and dissociative identity disorders. In 62% of cases, neural pathways degrade within 18 months, leading to total cognitive collapse.  
   - **Cause**: The GODSTRAND’s hyper-complex neural encoding overwhelms human brain architecture, causing misfiring synapses and plaque-like genetic deposits.  
   - **Case Study**: Operative WOLFPAK-017 exhibited auditory hallucinations of “voices from the strand,” culminating in self-termination after 14 months.  

2. **Physiological Instability**  
   - **Symptoms**: Uncontrolled cellular replication leads to tumorous growths, organ failure, and skeletal deformities. Skin lesions and spontaneous hemorrhaging occur in 73% of subjects.  
   - **Cause**: The GODSTRAND’s rapid transcription rate destabilizes human DNA repair mechanisms, triggering oncogenic cascades.  
   - **Case Study**: D.O.A. operative “Specter” developed a secondary skeletal structure that punctured vital organs, resulting in death during a mission.  

3. **Metabolic Collapse**  
   - **Symptoms**: Subjects require caloric intakes exceeding 20,000 kcal/day to sustain augmented physiology. Failure to meet this demand results in muscle atrophy, cardiac arrest, or coma.  
   - **Cause**: The GODSTRAND’s metabolic pathways operate at 300% human baseline, overloading mitochondrial function.  
   - **Case Study**: WOLFPAK-009 entered a catatonic state after 72 hours without specialized nutrient injections, later expiring.  

4. **Psychological Fragmentation**  
   - **Symptoms**: Severe paranoia, loss of empathy, and homicidal impulses are reported in 91% of subjects. Many lose their sense of self, adopting fragmented personas tied to the GODSTRAND’s genetic memory.  
   - **Cause**: The GODSTRAND appears to encode ancestral or alien consciousness, which overrides human psyche.  
   - **Case Study**: Operative D.O.A.-003, “Viper,” executed her entire team, claiming they were “impostors from the strand.”  

5. **Genetic Contagion Risk**  
   - **Symptoms**: In rare cases (4%), subjects’ altered DNA spreads to non-augmented individuals via blood or tissue contact, inducing lethal mutations.  
   - **Cause**: The GODSTRAND’s self-replicating sequences mimic viral behavior, bypassing immune defenses.  
   - **Case Study**: A containment breach in Facility 7 resulted in 12 civilian deaths from exposure to WOLFPAK-022’s blood.  

6. **Existential Disassociation**  
   - **Symptoms**: Subjects report feelings of “not belonging to this reality,” accompanied by visions of alternate timelines or dimensions. In 45% of cases, this leads to suicide or reckless behavior.  
   - **Cause**: Hypothesized to stem from the GODSTRAND’s potential origin as an extraterrestrial or interdimensional artifact.  
   - **Case Study**: WOLFPAK-014 abandoned a critical mission to “follow the strand’s call,” vanishing without trace.

### OPERATIONAL IMPLICATIONS  
- **High Attrition Rates**: Only 13% of augmented subjects remain operational after 24 months.  
- **Containment Protocols**: All operatives must be monitored for contagion risk. Termination is authorized if symptoms escalate beyond containment.  
- **Ethical Concerns**: The severity of side effects has led to dissent among oversight committees, with calls to halt Project WOLFPAK.

### RECOMMENDATIONS  
1. **Cease Non-Essential Augmentations**: Limit GODSTRAND integration to critical operatives until side effects can be mitigated.  
2. **Develop Countermeasures**: Invest in neural stabilizers and metabolic suppressors to extend operative lifespans.  
3. **Enhance Containment**: Upgrade isolation protocols to prevent genetic contagion.  
4. **Psychological Screening**: Implement stricter pre-augmentation psyche evaluations to identify at-risk candidates.

### CONCLUSION  
The GODSTRAND augmentations represent a double-edged sword: unparalleled power at the cost of near-certain suffering and death. The phrase “no longer men” (WOLFPAK mantra) is tragically apt, as subjects lose their humanity in both body and mind. Continued use of this technology must weigh the strategic necessity against the profound human cost.
