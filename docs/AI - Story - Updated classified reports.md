T.B.E. SIGHTINGS REPORT
DOCUMENT ID: CGS-SEC-47201   
DATE: 2025-04-25
DISTRIBUTION: Authorized Personnel (Level 7 Clearance and Above)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Following the 1908 Tunguska Event, operatives recovered anomalous genetic material at Ground Zero. Subsequent analysis identified a unique DNA structure, codename GODSTRAND. Inheritance of GODSTRAND markers have been linked to the emergence of biologically divergent individuals, classified as Terrestrial Biological Entities (T.B.E.s).

T.B.E.s demonstrate a range of nonstandard biological capabilities, posing elevated threats to public safety and environmental stability and global security. Surveillance, suppresion and containment protocols remain active.

WARNING: 
Unauthorized dissemination of this document constitutes a breach of national and international security protocols and is punishable by imprisonment under Articles 17, 22, and 41 of the International Covert Security Accord (ICSA), 2031 revision.

GODSTRAND AUGMENTATION: SIDE EFFECTS ANALYSIS
DOCUMENT ID: GL-OOS-0187
DATE: 1999-03-11
DISTRIBUTION: Authorized Personnel (Level 6 Clearance and Above)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The GODSTRAND is a complex genetic structure encompassing approximately 2 million base pairs. Partial sequencing and experimental integrations under Project WOLFPAK and auxiliary programs have yielded augmentations beyond known human capabilities. However, side effects associated with GODSTRAND integration are catastrophic in nature, with morbidity rates exceeding 83% within five years post-augmentation.

Continued research into stabilization protocols is considered Priority One under Operation [REDACTED].

WARNING:
This document is classified under the Global Human Enhancement Oversight Act (GHEOA) 1987. Unauthorized access, reproduction, or dissemination is punishable by immediate detainment and indefinite incarceration.

DETAILED SIDE EFFECTS:

1. NEUROLOGICAL DEGRADATION
   - Symptoms: Subjects experience synaptic overload, manifesting as seizures, hallucinations, and dissociative identity disorders.
   - Cause: The GODSTRAND's hyper-complex neural encoding overwhelms human brain architecture.

2. PHYSIOLOGICAL INSTABILITY
   - Symptoms: Uncontrolled cellular replication leads to tumorous growths, organ failure, and skeletal deformities.
   - Cause: The GODSTRAND's rapid transcription rate destabilizes human DNA repair mechanisms.

3. METABOLIC COLLAPSE
   - Symptoms: Subjects require caloric intakes exceeding 20,000 kcal/day to sustain augmented physiology.
   - Cause: The GODSTRAND's metabolic pathways operate at 300% human baseline.

4. PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAGMENTATION
   - Symptoms: Severe paranoia, loss of empathy, and homicidal impulses are reported in 91% of subjects.
   - Cause: The GODSTRAND appears to encode ancestral or alien consciousness.

5. GENETIC CONTAGION RISK
   - Symptoms: In rare cases, subjects' altered DNA spreads to non-augmented individuals via blood or tissue contact.
   - Cause: The GODSTRAND's self-replicating sequences mimic viral behavior.

6. EXISTENTIAL DISASSOCIATION
   - Symptoms: Subjects report feelings of "not belonging to this reality," accompanied by visions of alternate timelines.
   - Cause: Hypothesized to stem from the GODSTRAND's potential origin as an extraterrestrial artifact.
