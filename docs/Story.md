## Origin

When GOLDSTONE Laboratories discovered a portion of the mythic GODSTRAND they did not understand what they had until it was properly analyzed. A normal DNA strand has 23 chromosome pairs The GODSTRAND has 2 million.

It isn't difficult to see why the world would go to war to acquire it.

After becoming aware of the existence of T.B.E.'s (Terrestrial Biological Entity) the coalition governments of the world began their programs with the blessing of The United States.

The United States, The Soviet Union, The British EMpire and Israel began combing the world for people who were "special". They knew the coming conflict is one that they would lose, if they didn't have their own brand of T.B.E.

Those who were chosen had to be volunteers from the ranks of the worlds deadliest fighting forces. To insure maximum readiness, these individuals were modified...

The Agency most directly responsible for the "augmentations" is a shadow corporation whose existence is barely known... even to world leaders. A whisper network of Silicon Valley tech kings and a handful of oligarchs are the only ones who know their true purpose.

With nearly Limitless funding and a partial genetic map of "The GODSTRAND" nothing on Earth can stand in their way, and woe be to those who dare.

"Money... Power... Fear..."

In the days leading up to the confirmation that T.B.E.'s did in fact exist, panic set in. The KGB, C.I.A. and Israel's Mossad formed a joint task force.

Although projects were in development at the time, none of these countries were prepared for the clear and present danger demonstrated by T.B.E. 16 on Russian soil, where it is believed to have started.

The American response to T.B.E. 16 in the former Soviet Union was an unmmitigated disaster.

After the finger pointing and Sabre rattling died down, a Counter Measures Team was formed as a desperate response to T.B.E. sightings and incursions.

The Americans were in charge of the program and its implementation. Unconventional means were used to assemble the team(s)... the success rate was low.

Those that survived the augmentations were no longer classed as humans. They took on a new name...

WOLFPAK - These are the most dangerous men on the planet and they have no allegiance to anyone. Even their respective governments have a difficult time controlling them.

"A blind faith move made in desperation rewards no man."

"We are no longer men."

## D.O.A.

"Mercenenaries... are a necessary evil"

When the government of The United States put out inquiries for "heroes" to fight the scurge of the T.B.E., little did they know the hearts and minds of the men and women who would answer the call. Tens of thousands applied to be the next "hero".

Thousands washed out or were deemed "unfit". Less than a hundred survived the augmentations, and those that did wished they hadn't.

Some became those heroes... most did not. The augmentations were spectacular, the side effects were not.

One such "team" formed from the remnants of several others--**D.O.A.**

They sell their services to the highest bidder and they play on the world's stage. 

Today, they are you friends. Tomorrow, they will be hunting you.
